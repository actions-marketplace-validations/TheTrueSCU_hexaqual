# CHANGELOG

## v0.5.1 (2026-09-20)

### Fixes & Reliability
* **GitHub Action `skip-hooks` Input (`action.yml`)**: Added `skip-hooks` input (default: `hexaqual-agents`) to the reusable `TheTrueSCU/hexaqual` GitHub Action. The `SKIP` environment variable is now passed to `pre-commit run --all-files` in CI, preventing the `hexaqual-agents` hook from failing on clean checkouts where synced agent assets are absent from `.gitignore` by design. Consumers requiring no-skip behaviour can pass `skip-hooks: ""` explicitly.

## v0.5.0 (2026-09-19)

### Highlights & Features
* **Universal AI Guardrails & Agent Management (`hexaqual agents`)**: Introduced a first-class subsystem to bundle, synchronize, audit, and inspect shared `.agents/` rules, workflows, and skills across repositories (`sync`, `check`, `list`).
* **Bundled Universal Assets**: Packaged 9 universal rules (`hexaqual-boundaries`, `hexaqual-test-authoring`, `hexaqual-hermetic-testing`, `hexaqual-docstrings`, `hexaqual-workspace`, `hexaqual-typing`, `hexaqual-property-testing`, `hexaqual-security`, `hexaqual-sync`), 6 SDLC-aligned workflows (`hexaqual-pre-commit`, `hexaqual-pre-push`, `hexaqual-pre-release`, `hexaqual-scaffold-unit`, `hexaqual-mutation`, `hexaqual-sync`), and 3 agent skills (`hexaqual_audit_complexity.py`, `hexaqual_audit_docstrings.py`, `hexaqual_scaffold_test_parity.py`).
* **Repo-Specific Asset Preservation**: Strict preservation of local unmanaged rules (`hexa<X>-*.md`, `graphify.md`), ensuring individual family members can layer domain constraints without clobbering upstream standards.
* **Modular Pre-Commit Hook (`hexaqual-agents`)**: Added pre-commit gate verifying that managed assets in `.agents/` remain byte-for-byte identical to the installed `hexaqual` distribution.
* **Root `AGENTS.md` Index & Git Exclusion**: Automatically generates and refreshes an aggregated `AGENTS.md` index at repository root and registers it in `.git/info/exclude` to support single-file agent tools without git clutter.
* **SDLC-Aligned Gate Names**: Renamed pre-flight workflows to `hexaqual-pre-commit`, `hexaqual-pre-push`, and `hexaqual-pre-release` to create intuitive symmetry with git hook lifecycles.

### Fixes & Reliability
* **Fast Pre-Commit Sanity Execution**: Fixed CLI wrapper argument forwarding so `--skip-tests` dynamically bypasses pytest in `hexaqual sanity -a --skip-tests`, reducing pre-commit runtime from ~97s to <1s.
* **Documentation Link Checking in Code Spans**: Filtered out inline backtick code spans in `hexaqual docs links` to prevent false positive link parsing on Python generic syntax like `[T](item: T)`.

## v0.4.2 (2026-09-17)

### Fixes & Reliability
* **Graceful Graphviz Skip in Diagram Checks**: Gracefully skip diagram verification (`hexaqual deps pydeps --check`, `GeneratePydepsHandler`, `check_package_diagram`, `check_overview_diagram`, `check_all_diagrams`) with `SKIP` status and exit code 0 when Graphviz `dot` executable is absent from the host environment, preventing pre-commit and CI crashes on minimal containers.

## v0.4.1 (2026-09-17)

### Highlights & Features
* **Architecture Diagram Freshness Gate (`hexaqual-diagrams`)**: Introduced automated architecture diagram verification and synchronization via `hexaqual deps pydeps --check` / `--fix`, integrated into `hexaqual sanity` static checks and exposed as a modular pre-commit hook (`hexaqual-diagrams`).
* **Conditional Diagram Skip**: Automatically skips diagram verification cleanly (`CheckStatus.SKIP`) if Graphviz `dot` is absent or if no `docs/assets/pydeps/` directory exists.
* **Sanity Step Control (`--skip-diagrams`)**: Added dynamic `--skip-diagrams` workflow option to `hexaqual check` and `hexaqual sanity`.

## v0.4.0 (2026-09-16)

### Highlights & Features
* **Turnkey Composite GitHub Action (`action.yml`)**: Added turnkey composite GitHub Action supporting `pre-commit`, `sanity`, and `setup` execution modes with automated uv, Python, and pre-commit caching across CI pipelines.
* **Modular Pre-Commit Hooks Menu (`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`)**: Exposed standalone, reusable pre-commit hooks including `hexaqual-sanity`, `hexaqual-architecture`, `hexaqual-test-parity`, `hexaqual-statements`, `hexaqual-linter`, `hexaqual-extras`, `hexaqual-usage-docs`, and `hexaqual-docs-links`.
* **Documentation Link Integrity Scanner (`hexaqual docs links`)**: Added relative path, cross-file reference, and anchor integrity validation across Markdown documentation trees with table, JSON, and Markdown presentation adapters.
* **Standardized CLI Options & Pipe Detection (`hexaqual.cli.options`)**: Centralized `OutputFormat` enum, `format_option()` factory, and `resolve_format()` with automatic terminal TTY vs pipeline redirection detection across CLI diagnostic commands.
* **Hexaflow v0.3.0 Engine Upgrade**: Upgraded core workflow orchestrator dependency to `hexaflow>=0.3.0`.

## v0.3.0 (2026-09-14)

### Highlights & Features
* **Hexaflow v0.2.0 Integration & Dynamic CLI Binder Dogfooding**: Upgraded to `hexaflow>=0.2.0`, dogfooding `WorkflowCliBinder` to introspect workflow DAGs and dynamically bind CLI options (`--skip-ruff`, `--skip-ty`, `--skip-parity`, `--skip-statements`, `--skip-deptry`, `--skip-complexity`, `--skip-tests`) with `TriggerRule.ALL_SUCCESS_OR_SKIPPED` skip propagation across `hexaqual check` and `hexaqual sanity`.
* **Architecture Test Parity (`hexaqual parity architecture`)**: Introduced `check_architecture_test_parity` and the `hexaqual parity architecture` command to ensure that packages with internal hexagonal architectures maintain dedicated `test_hexagonal_boundaries.py` architectural test suites.
* **Colocated Dynamic Fuzz Harness Discovery**: Enhanced `hexaqual test fuzz` to dynamically discover and execute Atheris coverage-guided and OWASP security fuzz harnesses colocated within individual package test suites (`packages/*/tests/fuzz/test_fuzz_*.py`) alongside root harnesses.

## v0.2.2 (2026-09-14)

### Highlights & Features
* **Full Legacy Tool Subsumption**: Subsumed all 35 former `hexastack-tools` entrypoint scripts into first-class native `hexaqual` CLI commands across 8 sub-apps (`test`, `mutate`, `deps`, `imports`, `parity`, `statements`, `release`, `gh`, `docs`, `refactor`). All operations dispatch directly through the internal CQRS bus with zero legacy script dependencies.
* **Coverage-Guided & Adversarial Fuzzing (`hexaqual test fuzz`)**: Integrated Atheris coverage-guided and OWASP security fuzzing directly into the CLI via `FuzzRunCommand` with multi-format presentation (rich table, json, markdown).

* **Architectural Boundary Testing (`hexaqual test archon`)**: Added automated `pytest-archon` test generation across packages via `GenerateArchonTestsCommand`.
* **Automated Refactoring & Alphabetization (`hexaqual refactor`)**: Introduced `refactor` sub-application powered by Rope (`rename`, `extract`, `move`, `run`) and native AST code symbol alphabetization (`hexaqual refactor alphabetize`).
* **CodeQL SAST Scanning (`hexaqual gh codeql`)**: Wired GitHub CodeQL static analysis scanning into the `gh` sub-application via `ScanCodeQlCommand`.
* **Medium Article Publishing (`hexaqual docs publish`)**: Added automated Markdown article publishing to Medium via `PublishMediumArticlesCommand`.

* **Documentation & Catalog Refresh**: Regenerated full unrolled CLI tree in `USAGE.md`, updated `README.md` Command Overview table, and refined architectural layout in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## v0.2.1 (2026-09-13)

### Highlights & Features
* **Deptry Dependency Auditing Integration**: Integrated `deptry` as a first-class check in the `hexaqual sanity` DAG pipeline, verifying that all imports across production packages are cleanly declared in `pyproject.toml`.
* **Dependency Management Commands (`hexaqual deps`)**: Added dedicated `deps` sub-app with `hexaqual deps audit`, `hexaqual deps deptry`, and `hexaqual deps graph` (architecture dependency graphs via `pydeps`).
* **Granular Sanity Check Skipping**: Added CLI options to selectively skip specific checks during sanity verification (`--skip-tests`, `--skip-lint`, `--skip-types`, `--skip-complexity`, `--skip-statements`, `--skip-parity`, `--skip-deptry`).
* **CI Pipeline Gate Fortification**: Updated GitHub Actions release workflow to enforce pre-commit quality gate and unit test suite completion on tagged commits before triggering PyPI publishing.
